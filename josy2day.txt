Hi Frank,



Upon further investigation regarding this issue, I could also see that you are using OpenVZ virtualization and it won't be supported by RunCloud right now.



I also suggest you that, Could you please purchase a KVM server, then install RunCloud, then migrate everything over to the new server to avoid such issues permanently.

Hi,

You would have noticed that there is a separate area for defining open_basedir in your webapp settings, you would have to clear the term open_basedir from that area otherwise RunCloud will override the configurations.


Open_basedir is a security function in PHP that defines the locations or paths from which PHP is allowed to access files, so if you have disabled this feature, the user/attacker may be able to gain access outside the public path directory.


You can disable this temporarily by copy paste the open base directory to a secure location and once you have done you can enable it again.
