Hi Thank you for the response. We have analyzed your requirement in detail and arrived at the solution. 
To avoid confusion, we can start from the beginning, 
Firstly you need to follow these steps starting creation of extra configuration file in the path
/etc/nginx-rx/extra.d/<webappname>.location.main-before.*conf

Regarding the extra.conf , please follow the Steps:

Step 1: create an extra configuration file  etc/nginx-rc/extra.d/<webapp>.location.main-before.*.conf
Step 2: now provide the whole list of other domains that are added to this,
			if($host= otherdomains.com)
				{
					return 301 http://www.mydomain.com$request_uri;
				}
		the successive lines will be like 
			if($host  = someotherdomain.com)
				{
					return 301 http://www.mydomain.com$request_uri;
				}

Step 3: save the configuration file
Step 4: restart the nginx by

        service nginx-rc restart

        Checking syntax by
        nginx-rc -t



You need to insert the 31 rewrite rules inside an extra nginx configuration file like /etc/nginx-rc/extra.d/<webapp>.location.main-before.*.conf

Change web app with your actual web app name and * with anything you like.

eg: vi /etc/nginx-rc/extra.d/runcloud-blog.location.main-before.dominredirecct.conf

return 301 $scheme://www.new-name.com$request_uri;
